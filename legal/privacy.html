                <div class="text">Thank you for shopping with us. Watson Fit, INC. ("WatsonFit," "we," "our" or "us") is
                    fully committed to protecting your privacy. We'd like to take a minute to explain the information
                    that we collect from and about you, how we do it, how and why we use that information, and how your
                    information may be shared with third-parties.<br>&zwj;<br>First, it is important to understand that
                    this Privacy Policy governs and applies to your use of, and any content, products, or services made
                    available from or through, the website WatsonFit.com, including any subdomains thereof ("Website").
                    The Website is owned and operated by us.<br>&zwj;<br>Second, please be sure to read this entire
                    Privacy Policy before using or submitting information to or over the Website. By accessing the
                    Website on any computer, mobile phone, tablet, or other device, you agree to the terms of this
                    Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use this
                    Website.<br>&zwj;<br>Third, this Privacy Policy is only applicable to the Website and not to any
                    other websites that you may be able to access from the Website, each of which may have data
                    collection, storage, and use practices and policies that differ materially from this Privacy Policy.
                    When you leave the Website via a link to another website, you are subject to that site's privacy
                    policy, terms of use, and other policies ("Third Party website policies") applicable to that site
                    and you should review the Third Party website policies.<br>Fourth, we may modify this Privacy Policy
                    at any time. If we decide to change this Privacy Policy, we will post those changes to the Website.

                    Your continued use of the Website affirms your agreements to such changes.<br>&zwj;<br>Finally, this
                    Website is intended for users who are located in the United States of America. Any users of the
                    Website not located in the United States of America understand and agree to submit to the applicable
                    laws and jurisdiction(s) of the United States of America which govern the use of this Website and
                    the owner's collection and use of your personal information.<br> <br><strong>Section 1 - What
                        Information Do We Collect?<br></strong>We may collect two different types of information,
                    Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") and Non-Personally Identifiable Information ("Non-PII").
                    PII is information that identifies you as an individual - for example, your name, address, telephone
                    number, e-mail address, credit or other payment card information, billing address, and shipping
                    information. Non-PII is aggregated information, demographic information, IP addresses, user behavior
                    data from web interaction metrics tools and other information that does not reveal your specific
                    identity. PII and Non-PII may be collected anytime you access or use a WatsonFit website. PII and
                    Non-PII may also be collected by WatsonFit during in-person discussions, telephone conversations,
                    and electronic or other written communications. We also collect information via cookies, as
                    explained below in Section 4.<br>We collect information from you when you register on our Website,
                    place an order, enter a contest or sweepstakes, respond to a survey or communication such as e-mail,
                    or participate in another Website feature.<br>&zwj;<br>When ordering or registering, we may ask you
                    for your name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number, credit or other payment card
                    information, or other information. You may, however, visit our Website anonymously.<br>We also
                    collect information about gift recipients so that we can fulfill the gift purchase. The information
                    we collect about gift recipients is not used for marketing purposes.<br>&zwj;<br>Like many websites,
                    we use "cookies" to enhance your experience and gather information about visitors and visits to our
                    websites. Please refer to Section 4 below for information about cookies and how we use them.<br>
                    <br><strong>Section 2 - How Do We Use Your Information?<br></strong>We may use the information we
                    collect from you when you register, purchase products, enter a contest or promotion, respond to a
                    survey or marketing communication, surf the Website, or use certain other Website features in the
                    following ways:<br>&zwj;<br>1. To personalize your site experience and to allow us to deliver the
                    type of content and product offerings in which you are most interested;<br>2. To allow us to better
                    serve you in responding to your customer service requests;<br>3. To quickly process and fulfill your
                    transactions;<br>4. To administer a contest, promotion, survey, or other site feature; and<br>5. If
                    you have opted-in to receive our e-mail newsletter, we may send you periodic e-mails. If you would
                    no longer wish to receive promotional e-mail from us, please refer to the "How Can You Opt-Out,
                    Remove or Modify Information You Have Provided To Us?" in Section 8 below. If you have not opted-in
                    to receive e-mail newsletters, you will not receive these e-mails. Visitors who register or
                    participate in other Website features such as marketing programs and "members-only" content will be
                    given a choice whether they would like to be on our e-mail list and receive e-mail communications
                    from us.<br> <br><strong>Section 3 - How Do We Protect Visitor Information?<br></strong>We implement
                    a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your PII. Your PII is contained behind
                    secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access
                    rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. When you place orders
                    or access your personal information, we offer the use of a secure server. All
                    sensitive/credit/payment card information you supply is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
                    technology and then encrypted into our databases to be only accessed as stated above.<br>
                    <br><strong>Section 4 - Do We Use "Cookies"?<br></strong>Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or
                    its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your web browser (if you allow)
                    that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and
                    remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process the items
                    in your shopping cart. They are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous
                    or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We also use
                    cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can
                    offer better site experiences and tools in the future.<br>&zwj;<br>We may contract with third-party
                    service providers to assist us in better understanding our site visitors. These service providers
                    are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and
                    improve our business.<br>You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being
                    sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Netscape
                    Navigator or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your
                    browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you
                    won't have access to many features that make your site experience more efficient and some of our
                    services will not function properly. However, you can still place orders over the telephone by
                    contacting customer service.<br> <br><strong>Section 5 - Do We Disclose the Information We Collect
                        to Third-Parties?<br></strong>Yes. In certain circumstances, we may disclose your PII to
                    third-parties who assist in processing and shipping your order. Specifically, we may share this

                    purpose of processing and shipping your order. We may also disclose your PII to payment processors
                    and PayPal for the purpose of processing your order.<br>&zwj;<br>We may also disclose your PII to
                    third-parties as follows:<br>(a) If we believe it is necessary because we believe there has been a

                    or the rights of any third party;<br>(b) To respond and comply with legal process (such as a search
                    warrant, subpoena, or court order) and to provide information to law enforcement agencies or in
                    connection with an investigation on matters related to public safety, as permitted by law, or
                    otherwise required by law; and/or<br>(c) If we or some or all of our assets are acquired by another
                    company, including through a sale in connection with bankruptcy, that company will possess the
                    information collected by us and provided by you, and it will assume the rights and obligations
                    regarding your information as described in this Privacy Policy.<br>&zwj;<br>We may also disclose

                    confidential.<br>&zwj;<br>Non-PII may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or
                    other uses.<br> <br><strong>Section 6 - Who is Responsible for Safeguarding User Names and

                    <br><strong>Section 9 - Internet-Based Advertising<br></strong>We may partner with third-party
                    service providers to serve ads on our behalf on non-affiliated third party sites. These third party
                    websites and advertisers, or Internet advertising companies working on their own behalf, sometimes
                    use technology to send, directly to your browser, advertisements that appear on our Website. They
                    may also use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect anonymous information in order
                    to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. Some of those ads
                    may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on information we or
                    the online advertising network serving the ad collect about your online activities here and
                    elsewhere over time. For example, anonymous information collected across multiple sites that you
                    visit over time may enable the ad network to predict your preferences and show you ads that are most
                    likely to be of interest to you.<br>&zwj;<br>To opt out of these types of ads, please visit the
                    Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) for information about how to opt-out of internet-based

                    remarketing services to advertise on third party websites (including Google) to previous visitors to
                    our Website. This could mean that we advertise to previous visitors who haven't completed a task on
                    our Website, for example by using the contact form to make an inquiry. This remarketing could be in
                    the form of an advertisement on the Google search results page, or a site in the Google Display
                    Network. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve advertisements based on
                    someone's past visits to the Website. Of course, any data collected will be used in accordance with
