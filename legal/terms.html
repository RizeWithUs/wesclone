                    connection with their membership ("Membership") in accordance with these Terms. The first Membership
                    fee payable in accordance with these Terms is due when the Membership account is setup and payment
                    of the Membership subscription fee is a condition of Membership, or after your Free Experience
                    Membership ends and you have not canceled the automatic enrollment with us. Every calendar month (or
                    calendar year depending on the type of Membership applied for), your Membership account will be
                    charged the subscription fee for the following month's (or year's) subscription, together with any
                    other fees for the following month's (or year's) subscription (for example, proposed additional
                    personal training costs) plus any accumulated charges for the past period (for example, for
                    additional personal training costs incurred in the previous calendar month) (collectively, "Fees").
                    Failure by the Member to use any of the services available for a Member through its subscription to
                    WatsonFit does not relieve the Member of his/her payment obligations under these
                    Terms.<br>&zwj;<br>Potential registrants and/or Members can pay by credit card or debit card.
                    Payment details, together with details of the subscription package applied for, shall be collected
                    by us through our secure financial data collection mechanism, which transfers the details of the
                    potential registrant and/or Member's financial data (as well as subscription package data) to
                    PayPal's online payment system for processing. You acknowledge that we hold data regarding the
                    subscription package that is being signed up for by the Member, including the last four digits and
                    the expiration date of the card used to purchase the subscription package together with details on
                    when payment of Fees are due. The Member further acknowledges and agrees that by sending a request

                    ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT (INCLUDING

                    CONDITIONS OF USE AS A COURT WOULD.<br> <br>a. General<br>Arbitration is a manner of resolving a
                    "Claim" without filing a lawsuit. "Claim" means any dispute between you, WatsonFit, or any involved
                    third party relating to your account, your use of the Website, your relationship with WatsonFit,
                    these Terms, the Privacy Policy, and the Return/Exchange Policy. This includes any and all claims
                    that relate in any way to your use or attempted use of the services or products, and any act or
                    omission by WatsonFit or any third party (including, but not limited to, trainers), related to your
                    use or attempted use of the services or products. You, WatsonFit, or any involved third party may
                    pursue a Claim. WatsonFit agrees to final and binding confidential arbitration should it have any
                    Claims against you. Likewise, you agree to final and binding confidential arbitration should you
                    have any Claims against WatsonFit. By agreeing to arbitrate, you waive the right to go to court and
                    agree instead to submit any Claims to final and binding confidential arbitration. This arbitration
                    provision sets forth the terms and conditions of our agreement to final and binding confidential
                    arbitration and is governed by and enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act (the "FAA"), 9
                    U.S.C. §§ 1-16, as amended.<br> <br>b. Exceptions<br>Notwithstanding the foregoing, and as an
                    exception to final and binding confidential arbitration, you and WatsonFit both retain the right to
                    pursue, in small claims court, any claim that is within that court's jurisdiction and proceeds on an
                    individual (non-class) basis, including overdue account matters within the small claims court's
                    jurisdiction. WatsonFit will not demand arbitration in connection with any individual claim that you
                    properly file and pursue in a small claims court, so long as the claim is and remains pending in
                    that court. The following claims shall not be subject to final and binding arbitration and must be
                    adjudicated only in the state or federal courts located in Sacramento, California: (i) any dispute,
                    controversy, or claim relating to the infringement or validity of our proprietary rights, including
                    without limitation, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, copyrights, trade secrets, or patents,
                    or the intellectual property rights of a third-party; or (ii) an action by WatsonFit for temporary,
                    preliminary, or permanent injunctive relief, whether prohibitive or mandatory, or other provisional
                    relief, against you for breach or threatened breach of this Agreement. You expressly agree to
                    refrain from bringing or joining any claims that are excluded from final and binding arbitration
                    pursuant to this subsection "b" in any representative or class-wide capacity, including but not
                    limited to bringing or joining any claims in any class action or any class-wide arbitration. Small
                    claims matters may be filed in any small claims court with personal and subject matter jurisdiction
                    over the parties. For all other matters excluded from final and binding arbitration by this
                    subsection "b," the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal
                    courts located in Sacramento, California, and forever waive any challenge to said courts'
                    jurisdiction and venue.<br> <br>c. Required Pre-Dispute Procedures<br>We acknowledge and agree that
                    before initiating any Claim against the other, we agree to first contact the other with a written
                    description of the dispute, which shall include all relevant documents and information, and the
                    proposed resolution. You may send the written description of any dispute you have with us by e-mail
                    to support@watsonfit.com. WatsonFit will contact you by letter at the billing address you provided
                    to us or at the email address you provided to us. You agree to negotiate with WatsonFit or its
                    designated representative in good faith about your problem or dispute. If for some reason the
                    dispute is not resolved within 60 days after receipt of the written dispute, we agree to the dispute
                    resolution provisions below. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other term of this arbitration
                    agreement, we will have the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in state or federal
                    court located in Sacramento, California to enforce these Terms or prevent an infringement of a third
                    party's rights or our intellectual property rights, as stated in subsection "b" above. You hereby
                    expressly consent to, and forever waive any challenge to, the exclusive personal jurisdiction and
                    venue of said courts in such actions.<br> <br>d. Commencing Arbitration<br>You and WatsonFit agree
                    to commence any arbitration proceeding within 1 year after the Claim arises (the 1 year period
                    includes the required pre-dispute procedures set forth above) and that any arbitration proceeding
                    commenced after 1 year shall be forever barred.<br>e. Arbitration Location<br>If the amount in
                    controversy is $500 or less, then the arbitration may be conducted by telephone or by written
                    submissions. Otherwise, the arbitration shall be conducted in Sacramento, California unless
                    WatsonFit otherwise agrees to arbitrate in another forum requested by you.<br> <br>f. Organization,
                    Rules, and the Arbitrator<br>We each agree that any and all Claims other than those exempted under
                    subsection "b" above shall be submitted to final and binding confidential arbitration before a
                    single arbitrator of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). Either party may commence the
                    arbitration process by submitting a written demand for arbitration with the AAA, and providing a
                    copy to the other party, within the time period set forth in subsection "d" above. The arbitrator
                    shall be selected by agreement of the parties or, if the parties cannot agree, chosen in accordance
                    with Rules of the AAA. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the
                    AAA's Commercial Dispute Resolutions Procedures, Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related
                    Disputes, in effect at the time of submission of the demand for arbitration. The AAA's Rules are
                    available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and
                    sole authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, construction, validity,
                    applicability, or enforceability of these Terms, the Privacy Policy, the Return/Exchange Policy, and
                    this arbitration provision. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine
                    whether any dispute is arbitrable. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to
                    determine whether this arbitration agreement can be enforced against a non-signatory to this
                    agreement and whether a non-signatory to this agreement can enforce this provision against you or
                    WatsonFit.<br> <br>g. Fees<br>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be
                    governed by the AAA's Rules. We will reimburse the fees charged by the arbitrator for claims
                    totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, we
                    will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims
                    are frivolous. In all other respects, the parties shall each pay their own additional fees, costs,
                    and expenses, including, but not limited to, those for any attorneys, experts, documents, and
                    witnesses.<br> <br>h. Governing Law and Award<br>The arbitrator shall follow the substantive law of
                    the State of California without regard to its conflicts of laws principles. Any award rendered shall
                    include a confidential written opinion and shall be final, subject to appeal under the FAA. Judgment
                    on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.<br>
                    <br>i. Enforceability<br>This provision survives termination of your account or relationship with
                    WatsonFit, bankruptcy, assignment, or transfer. If the class action waiver is deemed unenforceable
                    (i.e., unenforceability would allow arbitration to proceed as a class or representative action),
                    then this entire arbitration provision shall be rendered null and void and shall not apply. If a
                    portion of this arbitration provision (other than the class action waiver) is deemed unenforceable,
                    the remaining portions of this arbitration provision shall remain in full force and effect.<br>
                    <br>j. Miscellaneous<br>Failure or any delay in enforcing this arbitration provision in connection
                    with any particular Claim will not constitute a waiver of any rights to require arbitration at a
                    later time or in connection with any other Claims except all Claims must be brought within the 1
                    year limitation period set forth above. This provision is the entire arbitration agreement between
                    you and WatsonFit and shall not be modified except in writing by WatsonFit.<br> <br>k.
                    Amendments<br>WatsonFit reserves the right to amend this arbitration provision at any time. Your
                    continued use of the Website, purchase of any services or product on or through the Website, or use
                    or attempted use of a WatsonFit service or product, is affirmation of your consent to such changes.

                    products on or through the Website, or use or attempted use of a WatsonFit service or product, is

                    INDIVIDUALLY AND ONLY THROUGH BINDING, FINAL, AND CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO

                    PRODUCT YOU PURCHASED, USED OR ATTEMPTED TO USE WITHIN THE 30 DAYS AND THE DATE YOU FIRST PURCHASED,

                    NOT ELIGIBLE TO OPT OUT OF THIS PROVISION AND YOU MUST PURSUE YOUR CLAIM THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION
                    AS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT.<br> <br><strong>SECTION 19 - WATSONFIT'S ADDITIONAL
                        REMEDIES<br></strong>In order to prevent or limit irreparable injury to WatsonFit, in the event
